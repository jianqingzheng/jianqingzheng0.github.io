I am a DPhil student in the Kennedy institute at the University of Oxford under the supervision of Prof. Tonia Vincent, Dr. Ngee Han Lim and Prof. Bartlomiej Papiez. Before that I obtained a MRes degree in the Hamlyn Center for Robotic Surgery at the Imperial College London under the supervision of Prof. Guang-Zhong Yang, and a BEng degree in Department of Electrical Engineering & Electronics at the University of Liverpool with the final year project supervised by Dr. Lin Jiang and the year-2 project supervised by Prof. Shusen Yang.

My current research interest is in biomedical data analysis and medical computer vision with an emphasis on the computational models and applications of machine learning based approaches.
