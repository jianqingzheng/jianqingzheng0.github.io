#Work and Intern#

* 2019 <b>Research Intern</b>, <i>Shanghai Jiao Tong University</i>
  * Implement a program for simulation of orthopedic surgery based on C++ with VTK package.

* 2018-2019 <b>Research Assistant</b>, <i>Imperial College London</i>
  * Studyed on the shape instantiation of partially-deployed stent-graft and the prediction of fully- deployed stent-graft from a fluoroscopy for navigation in robot-assisted Fenestrated Endovascular Aortic Repair (FEVAR).

* 2017 <b>Technical Development and Algorithm Design Intern</b>, <i>AlgoLib Ltd</i>.
  * Designed a recursive enumeration algorithm and combined it with dynamic programming to find the products’ prices using the longest increasing period. Obtained step matrices using dynamic programming to search the longest common subarray of increasing natural numbers in the issue-date array of the sorted prices. Cut processing time down from 8 hours using the company’s original traversing algorithm to 30 minutes with the designed algorithm. Additionally, applied ARIMA and ARFIMA and Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) to fit previous prices and predict future prices in Python.
